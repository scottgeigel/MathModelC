abstract out renderer/atlas so that consumers don't need to know about sdl
	Ideally this means I could change of renderer to be opengl. Or even a ascii ouput and keep the same interface...
	though the concept of pixels is still a little ingrained into the philosophy of maprenderer

maprenderer interfaces directly to renderer. It is part of the app and not a module.


add ability to have viewports so zooming could happen for much larget scale models
